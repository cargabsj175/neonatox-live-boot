<h1>Overview & Philosophy</h1>

<h2>What Neonatox Live Boot Is</h2>

<p>
Neonatox Live Boot is a handcrafted live boot system that builds a complete
Linux live environment using:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A custom initramfs</li>
  <li>A squashfs root filesystem</li>
  <li>OverlayFS for a writable runtime layer</li>
  <li>systemd as PID 1</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unlike automated systems, every stage of the boot process is explicit and
under developer control.
</p>

<h2>What This Project Is Not</h2>

<p>
Neonatox Live Boot intentionally avoids:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>dracut</li>
  <li>live-build</li>
  <li>initramfs generators with opaque logic</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not because those tools are bad, but because they hide the learning
process.
</p>

<h2>Educational First, Practical Second</h2>

<p>
The primary goal is education. However, the final system is robust enough
to boot from:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>USB</li>
  <li>CD/DVD</li>
  <li>Virtual machines</li>
  <li>IDE, SATA, NVMe, and USB storage</li>
</ul>

<p>
The design choices are explained throughout this documentation, including
mistakes made during development and how they were resolved.
